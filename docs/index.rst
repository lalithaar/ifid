Project Overview
================

The **Indian Food Informatics Data (IFID)** initiative is an independent research project conducted by `Lalitha A R <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dEiBWT8AAAAJ&hl=en>`_ at **IIT Madras**. This project is hosted under the IIT Madras academic ecosystem and focuses on addressing the "linguistic anarchy" prevalent on local food labels by mapping highly fragmented ingredient variants into a clean, functional, and canonical taxonomy.

As a **Public Good Infrastructure** project, all core datasets, schemas, and mapping logics will be released openly to foster transparency and data interoperability across the Indian food ecosystem.

Core Principles
===============

* **Public Infrastructure:** All outputs are released under the `CC BY 4.0 International License <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ to ensure accessibility for researchers, regulators, and industry stakeholders.
* **Neutrality & Balance:** The framework is designed as a non-adversarial resource, balancing **Consumer Safety** with **Brand Safety** and business constraints.
* **Responsible AI:** Utilization of NLP and fuzzy-matching logic with a strict focus on bias mitigation, explainability, and data integrity.

Research Pillars
================

The framework is validated across four cross-disciplinary domains:

1. **Nutrition Science:** Accuracy in taxonomical groupings and nutritional classification.
2. **Corporate & Regulatory Law:** Alignment with FSSAI standards and consumer protection frameworks, ensuring balance between brand and consumer interests.
3. **Linguistics & NLP:** Mapping regional language variants and brand-specific nomenclature to standardized identifiers.
4. **AI Ethics:** Ensuring algorithmic fairness and data integrity in the automated categorization of food additives and ingredients.

Current Status
==============

This project is currently in its **Pre-publication / Expert Review** phase. 

.. note::
   The full dataset is not yet public. We are currently seeking Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to review the executive summary and schema logic.
