Project Overview
================

The **Indian Food Informatics Data (IFID)** initiative is a research project conducted under the `Interdisciplinary Systems Research Lab (ISRL) <https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Interdisciplinary-Systems-Research-Lab-ISRL-Lalitha-a-R-2>`_. This project focuses on building a coordination layer for India’s food systems, organizing thousands of diverse ingredient expressions into stable, functional categories without erasing regional and cultural identity.

As a **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** project, IFID provides the architectural foundation necessary to enable interoperability between consumers, regulators, and industry. All non sensitive core datasets, schemas, and mapping logics are to be released openly to foster a transparent and efficient food data ecosystem.

The Current Stance
==================

The project has evolved from a technical data-cleaning exercise into a robust infrastructure model. Our core philosophy is that **diversity is not noise**. 

Rather than forcing linguistic convergence (standardization through elimination), IFID utilizes a layered architecture. This allows brands and regions to maintain their specific naming conventions while ensuring they coordinate seamlessly with national and global systems—including regulatory, trade, and health frameworks—through a shared coordination layer.

Core Principles
===============

* **Public Infrastructure:** All outputs are released under the `CC BY 4.0 International License <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ to ensure accessibility for researchers, regulators, and industry stakeholders.
* **Coordination without Convergence:** Enabling diverse expressions to map to stable identifiers while preserving regional specificity and cultural heritage.
* **Non-Adversarial Design:** A balanced framework designed as a shared resource for **Consumer Safety**, **Regulatory Efficiency**, and **Brand Operational Ease**.

Research Pillars
================

The framework is validated across four cross-disciplinary domains:

1. **Food Systems Coordination:** Creating stable identifiers for seamless data exchange across the supply chain.
2. **Regulatory Informatics:** Mapping fragmented labels to official standards to reduce compliance friction.
3. **Cultural Informatics:** Preserving regional identity and variety through a multi-layered identity-preservation mechanism.
4. **Computational Governance:** Implementing automated, audit-aware pipelines to manage food data at a national scale.

Current Status
==============

This project is in an active transition phase. **Please note that current data releases are preliminary.**

.. note::
   The initial datasets and mappings are being superseded by a more comprehensive version based on further research. This upcoming release will feature expanded coverage and a fully formalized coordination architecture.
